## Test Plan
- It tells the testing team exactly what they need to do for a specific project. This includes which tests they will run, what resources they will need, and when the testing will happen. It's a plan that outlines specific details like what to test, when to test, and how to test.
- It's tailored to a particular project, so it may change as the project progresses and as the team learns more from the tests they have already done.

## Test Strategy
- Think of it as a high-level document that outlines the overall approach and goals of testing activities across the organization. It answers broader questions like why testing is important for the company and what the main goals of testing are.
- This document usually doesn't change much and is used for a long time across many different projects. It sets the standard for how testing should be approached in general.

## [Difference Between Them](#)
> **The test plan is focused on the "how-to" for a specific project—providing detailed, step-by-step instructions for what will happen in the short term. Meanwhile, a test strategy gives the "big picture" of testing practices and principles that apply to many projects over a longer period.**
