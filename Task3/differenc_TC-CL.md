## Test Case: 

Provides specific steps to verify a particular function of the app. It includes setup, input, action, and expected result. Test cases are detailed and are useful in both manual and automated testing.

## Checklist: 

A simpler, high-level document used for quick reviews and audits. It does not include detailed steps but is a list of items or features to check. Checklists are best used for sanity checks, quick regression, and smoke testing when detailed validation is not required.

## [When we use a Checklist](#)

Checklists are ideal during the later stages of development or during maintenance when the application is stable and major functionalities are already tested and fixed. They are used for quick rounds of testing to ensure that the most critical functions of the application are still performing as expected after changes or updates.
