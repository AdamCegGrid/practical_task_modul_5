> **The Bug Life Cycle is the journey a bug goes through from discovery to resolution.<br>Track and manage the defect from inception to resolution**  

*Here are the typical stages:*

[New:](#) When a defect is initially found and reported.  
[Assigned:](#) The defect is reviewed and assigned to a developer to fix.  
[Open:](#) The developer begins working on the defect, investigating its cause.  
[Fixed:](#) The developer makes code changes, believes the defect is corrected, and reassigns it for testing.  
[Pending Retest:](#) The defect is waiting to be tested again.  
[Retest:](#) The tester verifies the fix to ensure the defect is resolved.  
[Verified:](#) The defect is confirmed fixed and the solution is verified.  
[Closed:](#) The defect is closed if no further issues arise.  
[Reopened:](#) If the issue persists, the defect can be reopened.  
[Deferred:](#) The defect resolution is postponed (e.g., due to priority, release constraints).
